Source Engine BSP Lightmap Editor
=================================

**Current version**: 0.2
**Developed by**: fubarFX, Enderlux

## About
This application is a lightmap editor for Valve Source Engine games.
When a Source Engine map (.bsp) is compiled, precalculated lighting data is packed into it.
These are the so called lightmaps. They provide static lighting to the world geometry.
If you're not happy with the precalculated results from the lightmap creation tool (vrad), you can use this tool to modify them.

Since this version only supported text editing for the color values, I updated the software to use images as a more intuitive representation for the lightmaps.

This project is open source. You are free to continue development on it!

## What's new?
- Lightmaps are now displayed as an image instead of text rgb values.
- Some improvements to the GUI
- Exposure adjustment: You can brighten or darken the preview of the lightmap
